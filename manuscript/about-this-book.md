# About this book

__iOS8: Day-by-Day__ is a book born out of a collection of articles posted on the
ShinobiControls blog
at [shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay](http://shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay). As
such, each chapter is entirely self-contained, and can be read completely
independently. It is not aimed at people who are new to iOS or programming. There are
great resources for this. Go and read them first, and then come back to this to learn
about all the great new things you can do in the latest version of iOS. See you soon!

## What you'll get from this book

- Short articles highlighting the key features of iOS 8, and how to use them.
- A full project with source code demonstrating how to use each feature. Every
chapter has an app or playground that features the new technology. This allows you to
see it "in the wild", not just "on paper", as it is in the documentation.
- "Lessons learnt" from creating the app. Often these parts can be more valuable than
the tech outline itself. This includes problems encountered and their associated
workarounds.
- A great understanding of how to update your existing apps to ensure compatibility
with iOS8.
- Hours of fun. Well, maybe...

## What you won't get from this book

- An introduction into how to develop your first iOS app. There are loads of great
resources for this.
- An introduction or exploration of finer points in Swift. Chapter 1 will cover some
of the headline issues, but the rest is left to the reader.
- A deep-dive into every new feature/framework in iOS8. This book is designed to be enough
to make you aware of what features are available, and how to get started with them.
Once you've got to that point, you'll be at home with the documentation.
- Recantation of the documentation. The book is very much designed to be
supplementary to the material provided by Apple.


## How to read this book

As mentioned, this book is a collection of articles originally posted on a blog.
Therefore each chapter stands on its own, and there is little importance placed in
their order. You can pick and choose your way through just the chapters that interest
you - treating the book entirely as a reference.

However, since the content makes up a comprehensive review of the new technologies
introduced in iOS8, reading the book in a more traditional, linear manner is
perfectly valid. This is likely to result in you gaining a better understanding of
iOS8 as a whole, but at the cost of learning about things you will probably never
use.


## Conventions

This book is not a tutorial on Swift. In fact, the only time that Swift itself is
discussed is in chapter 1 (_Swift for Blaggers_). However, nearly all the code is
written in Swift. This means that you'll need to have a reasonable understanding of
Swift in order to follow the code. Don't be put off by this if you're not well-versed
in Swift - it's not nearly as difficult as you might expect.

All the code is written in such a way that it doesn't rely on any Swift-only
features, so translation back into Objective-C should be a painless process.

Some of the chapters are relevant to OSX as well as iOS, but wherever possible, the
focus is very much on iOS. There is one exception to this (in chapter 10
_Playgrounds_), but this is noted within the chapter.

The code might not turn out to be "best practice" in Swift, but was written well
before any best practices had been established. However, it should all be pretty good
code, and easy to follow.

Some error handling and the suchlike might have been skipped over in the interests of
brevity and keeping 'on-message'. This is an arguably sloppy practice, but error
handling outside of a well-defined application context is not always especially
clear. It's left as an exercise to the reader.
