# Appendix

## The road ahead

So where next? In completing this book, you now know everything there is to know
about iOS8 right? Unfortunately, that's not quite true. You've got a good grounding
in the most important new technologies available, but by no means all of them. You
can find out about some of the others by watching the WWDC videos, or reading the
Apple documentation for iOS8.

You'll also need to dig deeper into the features you wish to utilize in your apps,
but once again, the Apple documentation is a good place to head. Don't forget that,
particularly with newer technologies, there is often additional information available
in the header files associated with the frameworks. It's always worth investigating
those if you can't find the answers you need in the formal documentation.

The most important aspect to improving as an iOS developer (as in life) is to try
stuff out. We learn by playing. Grab the source code from a chapter you like, and run
it up. Then try and work out how to do something slightly different. Yeah, things
will break, but that's how we learn. Luckily, in most of software, it doesn't matter
that things break. In fact, we make a living out of it.

## Useful resources

Some of the resources that you might find useful to expand your knowledge of iOS 8,
and to take your apps to the next level:

- [shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay](http://shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay). The
original blog post series from which this book was born. 
- [github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day). 
__iOS8 Day-by-Day Source Code__ is all hosted on Github, so you can clone, download
and fork it. Give it a go, and feel free to send across pull requests.
- [developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action).
__Apple Documentation__ is the canonical place to go to find out about all the
technologies in iOS.
- [developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/).
__WWDC Videos__ are the official source of new feature launches, recorded at WWDC in
San Francisco back in June 2014. Note that there are likely to have been some changes
to the APIs between what was announced in these videos and works now, but that
doesn't make them any less useful.
- [developer.apple.com/swift/blog/](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/). __Apple
Swift Blog__. This blog appears to be representative of the slight 'opening-up' of
Apple. It contains some great posts about how to get started with Swift, through to
some more advanced techniques.
- [asciiwwdc.com](http://asciiwwdc.com/) __ASCII WWDC__ contains searchable
transcripts from the recent years of WWDC - including 2014. This is an excellent
resource if you can't face trawling through yet another video.
- [Ray Wenderlich Swift/iOS8 Books Bundle](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/swift-tutorials-bundle?source=visualputty).
Ray's site is full of fantastic tutorials, and every year the team puts together some
tutorial based books about the new releases. This year was no different - in fact I
wrote 5 chapters about adaptive layout. If you prefer your learning in tutorial form,
then look no further than this excellent resource.
- [iosdevweekly.com](http://iosdevweekly.com/). __iOS Dev Weekly__ is a stalwart of
news about iOS. It's an excellently compiled newsletter that keeps you informed about
everything Apple and iOS development.
- [swiftnews.curated.co](https://swiftnews.curated.co/). __This week in Swift__ is a
weekly newsletter curated expertly by
[@NatashaTheRobot](https://twitter.com/natashatherobot). Includes a great collection
of articles specifically about Swift.
