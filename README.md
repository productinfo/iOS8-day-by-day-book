iOS8-day-by-day-book
====================

Apple delivered iOS 8 to the developer world at WWDC in June 2014, before
launching it at the wider world in September of the same year. The iOS 8
SDK was somewhat over-shadowed by the simultaneous announcement of a new
programming language in the form of Swift, however this didn't mean that
the core OS had been overlooked at all. Quite the opposite - a huge number
of new APIs had been introduced, powering tons of new functionality.

iOS8: Day-by-Day is a review of the most important of these. Busy developers
don't have time to trawl the WWDC videos and Apple documentation. Instead 
they'd like to get a high-level summary of the new possibilities, alongside
some working sample code. This is exactly what iOS8: Day-by-Day provides.
It started out as a blog series, and these blog posts now form the basis
of the book.
