# Preface

Apple's WorldWide Developer Conference (WWDC) of 2014 was held, as ever, in San
Francisco in June. It was the first event that introduced a formal ticket lottery
system, the previous year having sold out via the "internet connection lottery" in
just two minutes. There were high hopes and expectations from the event - what had
Apple been working on? What new coolness would be unleashed upon the developer world?

The headline-grabbing news was the introduction of Swift: a
new language that represents the future of programming Apple devices.
Understandably, the world got incredibly excited about this, and a plethora of experts
in programming language design suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This spawned many
blog posts, tutorials, books, talks and other content to allow developers to get a
handle on Swift.

This response was great. However, I think the it overshadowed the other
announcements that formed iOS 8 (and OSX Yosemite). iOS 8 introduced many thousands
of new APIs, with some fantastic new functionality, but got significantly less
attention than it deserved since it wasn't the new, shiny thing in the room. iOS8
affects developers before they need to worry about Swift. There are changes and
deprecations that require updates in existing apps, and there are new features that
apps should take advantage of to stay fresh and relevant to their users.

The other issue that accompanies new iOS releases, is that learning about the new
features is a time-consuming exercise. You could sit and watch the WWDC videos, but
each is an hour long, and video is a terrible way to learn things. The excellent 
[ASCII WWDC](http://asciiwwdc.com) goes some way to easing this pain, with the
text-transcripts, but it's still not the easiest approach. You could trawl through
the documentation and the header files associated with the new and updated
frameworks, but this also isn't an especially easy task. It's designed much more for
solving problems, than about feature discovery.

This book started out life as a series of 39 blog posts, imaginatively titled "iOS8:
Day-by-Day". The motivation behind the blog series was to cover the many great new
features in iOS 8, at a "feature-discovery" level. Each post introduced a feature new
to iOS 8, before running through the details you need to get started. Since every post
has an accompanying project, it wasn't limited to regurgitating the documentation,
but included experiences from actually using the new frameworks - common pitfalls,
and areas not covered by the documentation.

This book represents the collection of these 39 articles in a handy book format. It
was a lot of fun to write, and I hope you find some of the chapters useful to you.
